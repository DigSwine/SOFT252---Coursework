Appointments
Last Appointment Data - 05/01/2020:
	
The Appointments run off a real time clock, so create and accept an appointment using a secratery, to be able to view an appointment, or log into BRoss and go the 5th January 2020 using the buttons.

Appointments can ONLY by made for the current year.



Issues that need to be fixed -

No "," can be added in doctors notes as the seprator for the read in lines is ", ". Fixable by using a converter function to change the comma to a hiphon for saving and reverse this for the read in.
